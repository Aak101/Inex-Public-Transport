We are a small private company who's goal is to unify the various modes of public transport into a one stop destination.
Our company aims to make public transport and information on it to be accesible as easily as possible thus increasing efficency and boosting number of commuters.
Our website can not only give information about the means of public transport and their schedules but also can be linked to payment portals to directly buy the tickets required.
